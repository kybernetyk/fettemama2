fettemama 2
-----------
A blogging engine written in C++0x ... because I'm too lazy to do real work.

* dependencies:
	- libevent
	- mysql libs

* General notes:

There's an xcode project in the fettemama2 subfolder for easier development (clang autocomplete yeah!). 
There could be some problems with the run scheme as IT MAY HAVE a hardcoded binary path to execute.
To get it to compile you need to create a file called "admin_password" in the source directory with the following contents:
    std::string admin_password = "YOURSECRETPASSWORD";

This file is .gitignore'd for national security reasons.

also check config.h for settings!

* TODO:
	- add a templating system (preferably mustache style)
	- add session shits (cookies)

* license:
	- gpl v3
